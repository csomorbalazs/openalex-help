**OpenAlex is free.**

The website, API, and data snapshot are all available at no charge. The data is licensed as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) so it is free to use and distribute. As a [nonprofit,](https://ourresearch.org/) making this data free and open is part of our mission.

[Being sustainable](https://docs.openalex.org/additional-help/faq#whats-your-sustainability-plan) is also part of our mission! So, for users who’d like a higher level of service, we have the Premium plan that offers three benefits:

* **Faster updates,** so you can get fresher data,
* **Higher API limits,** so you can use the API more, and
* **Priority support** for faster and more detailed help.

**Update frequency**

We release a new [snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot) of OpenAlex every month. If you’d like more up-to-date data, you can poll our API to be notified of new and modified works every hour. That way your local copy of OpenAlex will be perfectly synced with ours.

To do this, you [just use two Premium-only API filters,](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-api-tutorials/blob/main/notebooks/getting-started/premium.ipynb) along with a unique API key we give you as part of your Premium subscription.

**API limit**

The API has a limit of 100,000 calls per day, with a maximum of 10 per second. However, for Premium users we can (and do) support millions of calls per day, with low latency and high uptime. You just need to include your unique Premium API key along with your requests, and you’re good to go.

**Priority support**

Premium subscribers get to go to the head of the queue when they have support requests. We can even schedule a support call with your team to give you custom advice on how to integrate OpenAlex into your system.
