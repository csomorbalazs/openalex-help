# Search authors

The best way to search for authors is to use the `search` query parameter, which searches the [`display_name`](broken-reference) field in a flexible way. Example:

* Get works with the author name "Carl Sagan":\
  [https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=carl sagan](https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=carl%20sagan)

Searching without a middle initial returns names with _and_ without middle initials. So a search for "John Smith" will also return "John W. Smith".

Names with diacritics are flexible as well. So a search for David Tarrago can return David Tarragó, and a search for David Tarragó can return David Tarrago. When searching with a diacritic, diacritic versions of the names are prioritized in order to honor the original form of the author's name. Read more about our handling of diacritics [here](https://blog.ourresearch.org/author-search-in-openalex-improved-handling-of-diacritics-within-names/).

## Search a specific field

You can also use search as a [filter](broken-reference), by appending `.search` to the end of the property you are filtering for:

* Get authors with the name "john smith" in the display\_name:\
  [https://api.openalex.org/authors?filter=display\_name.search:john smith](https://api.openalex.org/authors?filter=display\_name.search:john%20smith)

When searching for authors, there is no difference when using the `search` parameter or the filter `display_name.search`, since display\_name is the only field searched when finding authors.

| Search filter                                                              | Field that is searched             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [`display_name.search`](../filters/filter-authors.md#display\_name.search) | [`display_name`](broken-reference) |

You can also use the filter `default.search`, which works the same as using the [`search` parameter](search-authors.md#search-authors).

## Autocomplete authors

You can autocomplete authors to create a very fast type-ahead style search function:

* Autocomplete authors with "ronald sw" in the display name:\
  [https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/authors?q=ronald sw](https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/authors?q=ronald%20sw)

This returns a list of authors with their most cited work title as the hint:

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json">{ 
  "results": [
      {
          "id": "https://openalex.org/A2295942430",
          "display_name": "Ronald Swanstrom",
          "hint": "Identification and characterization of transmitted and early founder virus envelopes in primary HIV-1 infection (2008)",
          "cited_by_count": 12287,
          "works_count": 235,
          "entity_type": "author",
          "external_id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7777-0773"
       },
       ...
<strong>  ]
</strong><strong>}
</strong></code></pre>

The author hint is set to the author's most highly cited work by default. You can change that by adding the parameter `author_hint` which accepts values `highly_cited_work` (default) or `institution`. When set to `institution`, the hint displays the author's [last known institution](broken-reference) in format \<display\_name>, \<country\_code>.

* Autocomplete authors with the hint set to the author's last known institution\
