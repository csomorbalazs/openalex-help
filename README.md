# Overview

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/OpenAlex-logo-5.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**OpenAlex** is a free and open catalog of the global research system. It's named after the [ancient Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_of\_Alexandria) and made by the nonprofit [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/).

The heart of OpenAlex is the [OpenAlex dataset](broken-reference), which describes scholarly [_entities_ ](the-data/entities-overview.md)and how those entities are connected to each other. Types of entities include [works](the-data/works/), [authors](the-data/authors/), [sources](the-data/sources.md), [institutions](the-data/institutions.md), [concepts](the-data/concepts.md), [publishers](the-data/publishers.md), and [funders](the-data/funders.md).

Together, these make a huge web (or more technically, heterogeneous directed [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph\_theory)) of hundreds of millions of entities and billions of connections between them all.

We offer three ways to make use of this dataset:

1. [**The web interface** ](broken-reference)is the quickest way to get started. It lets you explore, search, and analyze the data with an intuitive visual app.
2. [**The API** ](broken-reference)offers a more powerful way to access the data, but requires some coding experience. It is a fast, modern REST API with generous limits and no authentication requirements. The web interface is built entirely on the API.
3. [**The data snapshot** ](broken-reference)is a full dump of the dataset available to download, which we update about once per month.

**All three of these options are free.**

We also offer [**OpenAlex Premium,** ](https://openalex.org/pricing)which includes services above and beyond the free tier, such as a higher daily limit for the API, and more frequent data updates. This is also a great way to support our mission and help keep us sustainable, so please check it out if you enjoy OpenAlex.

## Why OpenAlex?

OpenAlex offers an open replacement for industry-standard scientific knowledge bases like Elsevier's Scopus and Clarivate's Web of Science. [Compared to](https://openalex.org/about#comparison) these paywalled services, OpenAlex offers significant advantages in terms of inclusivity, affordability, and availability.

OpenAlex is:

* _Big —_ We have about twice the coverage of the other services, and have significantly better coverage of non-English works and works from the Global South.
* _Easy —_ Our service is fast, modern, and well-documented.
* _Open —_ Our complete dataset is free under the CC0 license, which allows for transparency and reuse.
