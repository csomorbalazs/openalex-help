# About us

## Past and future

Let's start _way_ back at the beginning, with the ancient [Library of Alexandria.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_of\_Alexandria) Working create a Universal Library, they didn't just gather knowledge â€” they made it useful by indexing it in the world's first library catalog, the [Pinakes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinakes) That's what we're trying to do, too, and so our name is an homage to them!

Fast forward a few millenia: OpenAlex had been a dream at [our little nonprofit](https://ourresearch.org) for a long time, but two doors opened simultaneously in May 2021. First, [we received a generous grant](https://blog.ourresearch.org/arcadia-2021-grant/) from [Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/) Second, Microsoft announced it would shutter [Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG),](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/) which much of the community has come to rely upon as our best index of scholarly communication. So, we had the means and the opportunity, and we ran with it!

OpenAlex beta launched on January 3rd, 2022. The data is available via an [API](https://docs.openalex.org/) and a full [database snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot), and the [web application](https://openalex.org) to search and explore the data launched in beta October, 2023.

## Comparison with other scholarly data sources

How does OpenAlex compare to other scholarly data sources like Dimensions, Scopus, Google Scholar, etc.?

That is a big question! There are many ways to measure this, and we encourage you to try out the different options to see what is best for you.

## Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank everyone behind all our [data sources,](https://openalex.org/about#sources) but especially the folks at [MAG](https://aka.ms/msracad) for building a really audacious and cool thing, and providing us lots of help and support as we build its replacement.
