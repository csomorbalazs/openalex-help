## ðŸ“„ Works

Works are scholarly documents like journal articles, books, datasets, and theses.

OpenAlex indexes over 240M works, with about 50,000 added daily.

This is what a work looks like in OpenAlex:

### Abstract

This is the abstract of the work.

OpenAlex has abstracts for X% of works.

### Authors

The people who created this work.

In the context of a work, we actually think of each author as an "authorship," which is a single author and their institutional affiliations for this work.

### Identifiers

All the external identifiers that we know about for this work.

IDs are expressed as URIs whenever possible. Possible ID types:

* DOI: The [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_object\_identifier).
* MAG: The [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/) ID
* OpenAlex The OpenAlex ID
* Pubmed: The [Pubmed Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed#PubMed\_identifier)
* Pubmed Central The [Pubmed Central identifier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/public-access-info/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Most works are missing one or more ID types (either because we don't know the ID, or because it was never assigned). Keys for `null` IDs are not displayed.

### Locations

The locations online where a work lives, often in different versions.

Locations are meant to capture the way that a work exists in different versions. So, for example, a work may have a version that has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal (the [version of record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version\_of\_record)). This would be one of the work's locations. It may have another version available on a preprint server like [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)â€”this version having been posted before it was accepted for publication. This would be another one of the work's locations.

Below is an example of a work in OpenAlex ([https://openalex.org/W2807749226](https://openalex.org/W2807749226)) that has multiple locations with different properties. The version of record, published in a peer-reviewed journal, is listed first, and is not open-access. The second location is a university repository, where one can find an open-access copy of the published version of the work. Other locations are listed below.

Locations are meant to cover anywhere that a given work can be found. This can include journals, proceedings, institutional repositories, and subject-area repositories like [arXiv ](https://arxiv.org/)and [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/). If you are only interested in a certain one of these (like journal), you can use a [filter](broken-reference) to specify the `locations.source.type`.
