## ðŸ’° Funders

Funders are organizations that fund research.

OpenAlex indexes about 32,000 funders. Funder data comes from Crossref, and is enhanced with data from Wikidata and ROR. You can get a funder from the OpenAlex API like this:

* Get the funder National Institutes of Health (NIH) with OpenAlex ID `F4320332161`\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/funders/F4320332161`](https://api.openalex.org/funders/F4320332161)

Funders are connected to works through [grants.](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/works/work-object/README.md#grants)

## Funder attributes

### `counts_by_year`

To put it another way: each year, you can see how many works are linked to this funder, and how many times _any_ work linked to this funder was cited.

Years with zero citations and zero works have been removed so you will need to add those back in if you need them.

```json
counts_by_year: [
    {
        year: 2021,
        works_count: 4211,
        cited_by_count: 120939

### `ids`

All the external identifiers that we know about for this funder.

IDs are expressed as URIs whenever possible. Possible ID types:

* `openalex` _String:_ this funder's [OpenAlex ID](../the-api/get-single-entities/#the-openalex-id)
* `ror` _String:_ this funder's ROR ID
* `wikidata` _String:_ this funder's [Wikidata ID](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Identifiers)

```json
ids: {
    openalex: "https://openalex.org/F4320332161",
    ror: "https://ror.org/01cwqze88",
    wikidata: "https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q390551"

```

### `roles`

List of roles that this organization has, such as Institution, Funder, and Publisher.

In many cases, a single organization does not fit neatly into one role. For example, Yale University is a single organization that is a research university, funds research studies, and publishes an academic journal. The `roles` property links the OpenAlex entities together for a single organization, and includes counts for the works associated with each role.

Each `role` object in the list includes the `role` (one of `institution`, `funder`, or `publisher`), the `id` ([OpenAlex ID](../the-api/get-single-entities/#the-openalex-id)), and the `works_count`.

The `roles` list of an entity ([Funder](funders.md), [Publisher](publishers.md), or [Institution](institutions.md)) always includes itself. In the case where an organization only has one role, the `roles` will be a list of length one, with itself as the only item.

```json
roles: [
    {
        role: "funder",
        id: "https://openalex.org/F4320308380",
        works_count: 1004,
    },
    {
        role: "publisher",
        id: "https://openalex.org/P4310315589",
        works_count: 13986,
    },
    {
        role: "institution",
        id: "https://openalex.org/I32971472",
        works_count: 250031,
    }
]
```

### `summary_stats`

Citation metrics for this funder

* `2yr_mean_citedness` _Float_: The 2-year mean citedness for this funder. Also known as [impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact\_factor).
* `h_index` _Integer_: The [_h_-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) for this funder.
* `i10_index` _Integer_: The [i-10 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author-level\_metrics#i-10-index) for this funder.

While the _h_-index and the i-10 index are normally author-level metrics and the 2-year mean citedness is normally a journal-level metric, they can be calculated for any set of papers, so we include them for funders.

```json
summary_stats: {
    2yr_mean_citedness: 5.065784263815827,
    h_index: 985,
    i10_index: 176682
