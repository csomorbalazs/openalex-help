# Search concepts

The best way to search for concepts is to use the `search` query parameter, which searches the [`display_name`](broken-reference) and [`description`](broken-reference) fields. Example:

* Search concepts' `display_name` and `description` for "artificial intelligence":\
  [https://api.openalex.org/concepts?search=artificial intelligence](https://api.openalex.org/concepts?search=artificial%20intelligence)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can read more about search [here](../get-lists-of-entities/search-entities.md). It will show you how relevance score is calculated and how words are stemmed to improve search results.
{% endhint %}

## Search a specific field

You can also use search as a [filter](broken-reference), allowing you to fine-tune the fields you're searching over. To do this, you append `.search` to the end of the property you are filtering for:

* Get concepts with "medical" in the `display_name`:\
  [https://api.openalex.org/concepts?filter=display\_name.search:medical](https://api.openalex.org/concepts?filter=display\_name.search:medical)

The following field can be searched as a filter within concepts:

| Search filter                                                               | Field that is searched             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [`display_name.search`](../filters/filter-concepts.md#display\_name.search) | [`display_name`](broken-reference) |

You can also use the filter `default.search`, which works the same as using the [`search` parameter](search-concepts.md#search-concepts).

## Autocomplete concepts

You can autocomplete concepts to create a very fast type-ahead style search function:

* Autocomplete concepts with "comp" in the `display_name`:\
  [https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/concepts?q=comp](https://api.openalex.org/autocomplete/concepts?q=comp)

This returns a list of concepts with the description set as the hint:

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json">{ 
  "results": [
    {
        "id": "https://openalex.org/C41008148",
