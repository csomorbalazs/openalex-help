[**OpenAlex** ](https://openalex.org)is a free and open catalog of the global research system. It's named after the [ancient Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_of\_Alexandria) and made by the nonprofit [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/).

These are the help pages for OpenAlex, containing information about the [data](the-data/entities-overview.md), the [website](https://openalex.org) where you can start exploring, and the background concepts. To learn about the API, the data snapshot, and other fun stuff, head over to our [technical documentation.](https://docs.openalex.org)

## What is OpenAlex?

At the heart of OpenAlex is our dataset—a catalog of [works](the-data/works/). A work is any sort of scholarly output. A research article is one kind of work, but there are others such as datasets, books, and dissertations. We keep track of these works—their titles (and abstracts and full text in many cases), when they were created, etc. But that's not all we do. We also keep track of the _connections_ between these works, finding associations through things like [journals](the-data/sources.md), [authors](the-data/authors/), [institutional affiliations](the-data/institutions.md), citations, [concepts](the-data/concepts.md), and [funders](the-data/funders.md). There are hundreds of millions of works out there, and tens of thousands more being created every day, so it is important that we have these relationships to help us make sense of research at a large scale.

This type of data is a valuable resource to institutions, researchers, governments, publishers, funders, and anyone else interested in global research and scholarly communication. We offer the data freely so that its value can be shared. Using the website, anyone can get started right away exploring the data to learn about all sorts of things, from individual papers, to global research trends.

## Why OpenAlex?

OpenAlex offers an open replacement for industry-standard scientific knowledge bases like Elsevier's Scopus and Clarivate's Web of Science. [Compared to](https://openalex.org/about#comparison) these paywalled services, OpenAlex offers significant advantages in terms of inclusivity, affordability, and availability.

OpenAlex is:

* _Big —_ We strive to be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible, especially for works in other languages and the Global South.
* _Easy —_ Our service is fast, modern, and well-documented.
* _Open —_ Our complete dataset is free under the CC0 license, which allows for transparency and reuse.

We believe the global research system is one of humankind's most beautiful creations. OpenAlex aims to make that whole beautiful creation available to everyone, everywhere.

Many people and organizations have already found great value using OpenAlex. Have a look at the [Testimonials](https://openalex.org/testimonials) to hear what they've said!

## Who are we?

[OurResearch ](https://ourresearch.org/)is a nonprofit that builds tools for Open Science, including OpenAlex, [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/), and [Unsub](https://unsub.org/), among [others](https://ourresearch.org/projects). Our open-source tools are used by millions every day, in universities, businesses, and libraries worldwide, to uncover, connect, and analyze research products.

Openness is one of our core values, and so we strive to bake it into everything we do—including our [data](the-data/entities-overview.md), [code](https://github.com/orgs/ourresearch/repositories?language=\&q=openalex\&sort=\&type=public), software, and [organizational practices](https://ourresearch.org/transparency).
