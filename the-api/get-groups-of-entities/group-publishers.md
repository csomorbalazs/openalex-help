You can group publishers with the `group_by` parameter:

* Get counts of publishers by [`country_codes`](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-api/get-groups-of-entities/publisher-object.md#country\_codes):\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/publishers?group\_by=country\_codes`](https://api.openalex.org/publishers?group\_by=country\_codes)

Or you can group using one the attributes below.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's best to [read about group by](./) before trying these out. It will show you how results are formatted, the number of results returned, and how to sort results.
{% endhint %}
