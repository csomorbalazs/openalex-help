# 🏫 Institutions

## OpenAlex Institutions

Institutions are universities and other organizations to which authors claim affiliations.

We work closely with [ROR](https://ror.org/), so every OpenAlex institution has a corresponding entry in ROR.

Our information about institutions comes from several sources: Crossref, PubMed, ROR, MAG, and publisher websites. In order to link institutions to works, we parse every affiliation listed by every author. These affiliation strings can be quite messy, so we’ve trained an algorithm to interpret them and extract the actual institutions with reasonably high reliability.

For a simple example: we will treat both “MIT, Boston, USA” and “Massachusetts Institute of Technology” as the same institution ([https://ror.org/042nb2s44](https://ror.org/042nb2s44)).
