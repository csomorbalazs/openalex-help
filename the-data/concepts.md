# ðŸ’¡ Concepts

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts

Concepts are abstract ideas that works are about.

OpenAlex indexes about 65k concepts. You can get a concept from the OpenAlex API like this:

* Get the concept with OpenAlex ID `C41008148`\
  [https://api.openalex.org/concepts/C41008148](https://api.openalex.org/concepts/C41008148)

The [Canonical External ID](../the-api/get-single-entities/#canonical-external-ids) for OpenAlex concepts is the Wikidata ID, and each of our concepts has one, because all OpenAlex concepts are also Wikidata concepts.

Concepts are hierarchical, like a tree. There are 19 root-level concepts, and six layers of descendants branching out from them, containing about 65 thousand concepts all told. This concept tree is a modified version of [the one created by MAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12216). You can view all the concepts and their position in the tree [as a spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBFHjPt4rj\_9r0t0TTAlT68NwOtNH8Z21lBMsJDMoZg/edit#gid=1473310811). About 85% of works are tagged with at least one concept (here's the [breakdown of concept counts per work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17DoJjyl1XVNZdVWs7fUy91z69U2tD8qtnBsaqJ-Zigo/edit#gid=0)).

### How concepts are assigned

Each work is tagged with multiple concepts, based on the title, abstract, and the title of its host venue. The tagging is done using an automated classifier that was trained on MAGâ€™s corpus; you can read more about the development and operation of this classifier in [Automated concept tagging for OpenAlex, an open index of scholarly articles.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgXSLriHO3Ekz0OYoaoP\_h0sPcuvV4EqX7VgLLblKe4/edit) You can implement the classifier yourself using [our models and code](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-concept-tagging).

A score is available for each [concept in a work](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/works/work-object/README.md#concepts), showing the classifier's confidence in choosing that concept. However, when assigning a lower-level child concept, we also assign all of its parent concepts all the way up to the root. This means that some concept assignment scores will be 0.0. The tagger adds concepts to works written in different languages, but it is optimized for English.

Concepts are linked to works via the [`concepts`](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/works/work-object/README.md#concepts) property. Theyâ€™re also linked to [authors](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/authors/author-object.md), [sources](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/api-entities/sources/sources-object.md), and [institutions](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/institutions/institution-object.md) via the `x_concepts` property, and to other concepts via the [`ancestors`](concepts.md#ancestors) and [`related_concepts`](concepts.md#related\_concepts) properties.

## Concept attributes

### `ancestors`

List of concepts that this concept descends from.

Ancestor concepts are represented as [dehydrated Concept](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/concepts/concept-object.md#the-dehydratedconcept-object) objects. See the [concept tree section](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/concepts/concept-object.md#the-concept-tree) for more details on how the different layers of concepts work together.

```json
ancestors: [
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C2522767166",
        wikidata: "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2374463",
        display_name: "Data science",
        level: 1
    },
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C161191863",
        wikidata: "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q199655",
        display_name: "Library science",
        level: 1
    },
    
    // and so forth
]
```

### `cited_by_count`

The number of citations to works that have been tagged with this concept.

Less formally: the number of citations to this concept. For example, if there are just two works tagged with this concept and one of them has been cited 10 times, and the other has been cited 1 time, `cited_by_count` for this concept would be `11`.

```json
cited_by_count: 20248 
```

### `counts_by_year`

The works count and cited-by count of this concept for the last ten years, binned by year.

To put it another way: for every listed year, you can see how many new works were tagged with this concept, and how many times _any_ work tagged with this concept got cited.

Years with zero citations and zero works have been removed so you will need to add those back in if you need them.

```json
counts_by_year: [
    {
        year: 2021,
        works_count: 4211,
        cited_by_count: 120939
    },
    {
        year: 2020,
        works_count: 4363,
        cited_by_count: 119531
    },
    
    // and so forth
]
```

### `created_date`

### `related_concepts`

Concepts that are similar to this one.

Each listed concept is a [dehydrated Concept](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/concepts/concept-object.md#the-dehydratedconcept-object) object, with one additional attribute:

* `score` (_Float_): The strength of association between this concept and the listed concept, on a scale of 0-100.

```json
related_concepts: [
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C2778793908",
        wikidata: null,
        display_name: "Citation impact",
        level: 3,
        score: 4.56749
    },
    {

        wikidata: null,
        display_name: "Impact factor",
        level: 2,
        score: 4.46396
    }
    
    // and so forth

```

### `summary_stats`

Citation metrics for this concept

* `2yr_mean_citedness` _Float_: The 2-year mean citedness for this concept. Also known as [impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact\_factor).
* `h_index` _Integer_: The [_h_-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) for this concept.
* `i10_index` _Integer_: The [i-10 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author-level\_metrics#i-10-index) for this concept.

While the _h_-index and the i-10 index are normally author-level metrics and the 2-year mean citedness is normally a journal-level metric, they can be calculated for any set of papers, so we include them for concepts.

```json
summary_stats: {
    2yr_mean_citedness: 1.5295340589458237,
    h_index: 105,
    i10_index: 5045
}
```

Expressed as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date string.

```json
updated_date: "2021-12-25T14:04:30.578837"
```

### `wikidata`

The Wikidata ID for this concept.

This is the [Canonical External ID](../the-api/get-single-entities/#canonical-external-ids) for concepts.

{% hint style="info" %}
_All_ OpenAlex concepts have a Wikidata ID, because all OpenAlex concepts are also Wikidata concepts.
{% endhint %}

```json
wikidata: "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14565201"
```

### `works_api_url`

A URL that will get you a list of all the works tagged with this concept via the OpenAlex API.

We express this as an API URL (instead of just listing the works themselves) because there might be millions of works tagged with this concept, and that's too many to fit here.

```json
works_api_url: "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=concept.id:C2778407487"
```

### `works_count`

The number of works tagged with this concept.

```json
works_count: 3078 
```

## The `DehydratedConcept` object

The `DehydratedConcept` is stripped-down [`Concept`](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs/blob/sandbox/the-data/concepts/concept-object.md#the-concept-object) object, with most of its properties removed to save weight. Its only remaining properties are:

* ``[`display_name`](concept-object.md#display\_name)``
* ``[`id`](concept-object.md#id)``
* ``[`level`](concept-object.md#level)``
* ``[`wikidata`](concept-object.md#wikidata)``

## What's next

Using the API, you can fetch, filter, search, and group data about concepts:
