# ðŸ’¡ Concepts

We're working on a new system to assign topics to works, which we will be rolling out soon. To get the latest updates, join the [OpenAlex user group](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users).

Our current concepts uses a system adapted from MAG to assign multiple concepts to works using their titles and abstracts. You can learn more about these concepts and how they are assigned [in our technical documentation here.](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/concepts)
