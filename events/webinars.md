We welcome guest presenters from two commercial organizations to highlight how they are making use of OpenAlex:

+ [**Inseres:**](https://inseres.com/en/) [Piri Discovery Service](https://inseres.com/en/product/piri.html) is a corporate academic search engine enabling users to search academic articles with full-text access easily and efficiently. Piri uses the OpenAlex API to link the publications of our subscribing institutions to provide users with rich metadata about academic publications. (Presenter: Ahmet A. Müngen, Founder and CTO, Inseres)

+ [**ChronosHub:**](https://chronoshub.io/) In this webinar we’ll dive into Open Access and Open Science challenges for institutions and funders, and how ChronosHub is leveraging OpenAlex to enable as much automation as possible along the entire publishing journey. You will learn how a combination of integrations and AI document scanning unburdens the researchers and administrators from initial manuscript submission through to APC payments, OA agreement monitoring, grant outputs reporting and fulltext deposits, but also what remains in store to tackle. (Presenter: Martin Jagerhorn, VP Business Development, ChronosHub)

### April 11, 2024, 12pm EDT — The OpenAlex API Part 1: Getting Started <a href="#openalex-api-part-1" id="openalex-api-part-1"></a>

[**Click here to register**](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN\_k1OfebT4RdGoylw6FVqiuw)

The OpenAlex User Interface is designed to make common use cases as simple as possible. The OpenAlex Application Programming Interface (API) supports endless use cases but requires some coding skills from the user. This webinar will introduce basics of the OpenAlex API, when to use it vs the UI, and how the UI can support first time API users.

### April 25, 2024, 12pm EDT — The OpenAlex API Part 2: Diving In <a href="#openalex-api-part-2" id="openalex-api-part-2"></a>

[**Click here to register**](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN\_Jtr5dZWuTgGojGC3yDRG5w)

This webinar will focus on how to use the OpenAlex API (see Part 1 for introductory overview). We will review the basics of constructing API requests and using results. We will then walk through how to perform a few specific examples of analyses not possible in the User Interface that are easily achieved using the API. For this demonstration, we will be coding in Python.
