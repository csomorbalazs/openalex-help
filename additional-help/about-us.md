# About us

OpenAlex is a free and open catalog of the world's scholarly papers, researchers, journals, and institutions — along with all the ways they're connected to one another.

Using OpenAlex, you can **build** your own scholarly search engine, recommender service, or trend detector. You can help **manage** research by tracking impact, spotting emerging fields, and identifying key groups. And you can do **research** to better understand how scholarship works..

Because we think all research should be free and open, OpenAlex is free and open itself:

* We're operated by a [sustainable and transparent nonprofit,](http://ourresearch.org/transparency)
* our [complete dataset](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot) is free under the [CC0 license,](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
* We offer a [free API,](https://docs.openalex.org/) and
* [Our code ](https://github.com/orgs/ourresearch/repositories?language=\&q=openalex\&sort=\&type=public)is fully open-source.

We believe the global research system is one of humankind's most beautiful creations. OpenAlex aims to make that whole beautiful creation available to everyone, everywhere.

**Past and future**

Let's start _way_ back at the beginning, with the ancient [Library of Alexandria.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_of\_Alexandria) Working create a Universal Library, they didn't just gather knowledge — they made it useful by indexing it in the world's first library catalog, the [Pinakes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinakes) That's what we're trying to do, too, and so our name is an homage to them!

Fast forward a few millenia: OpenAlex had been a dream at [our little nonprofit](https://ourresearch.org) for a long time, but two doors opened simultaneously in May 2021. First, [we received a generous grant](https://blog.ourresearch.org/arcadia-2021-grant/) from [Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/) Second, Microsoft announced it would shutter [Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG),](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/) which much of the community has come to rely upon as our best index of scholarly communication. So, we had the means and the opportunity, and we ran with it!

OpenAlex beta launched on January 3rd, 2022. The data is available via an [API](https://docs.openalex.org/) and a full [database snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot), and the web application to search and explore the data launched in beta July, 2023.

**Contact**

We'd love to hear from you! If you have a question, and you can't find the answer in our [documentation](https://docs.openalex.org/), submit a ticket via our [help page](https://openalex.org/help).

You can also stay in touch with us via the [OpenAlex User Group](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users) and via Twitter ([@OpenAlex\_org](https://twitter.com/openalex\_org)) and Mastodon ([@OpenAlex@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@OpenAlex)).

**Comparison with other scholarly data sources**

How does OpenAlex compare to other scholarly data sources like Dimensions, Scopus, Google Scholar, etc.?

That is a big question! There are many ways to measure this, and we encourage you to try out the different options to see what is best for you.

[Here we offer a comparison of some of the different options available.](https://openalex.org/about)

**Acknowledgements**

We'd like to thank everyone behind all our [data sources,](https://openalex.org/about#sources) but especially the folks at [MAG](https://aka.ms/msracad) for building a really audacious and cool thing, and providing us lots of help and support as we build its replacement.
